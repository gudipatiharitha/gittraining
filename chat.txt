Swastik: Hi
Kishore:hello
Swastik: @kishore .., How to pull changes from master branch to child branch?
Kishore:rebase??
Swastik: "Current branch branch1 is up to date." , but file in master branch has different content
<<<<<<< HEAD
Vishal:Hello
=======
Swastik: What happens when we commit without staging the files?
Rishan:I tried it...they got commited :p
Shanmukh: Hey!
Himatej: hello.
Swastik: I think when we use "git commit -a" , it automatically adds n commit , but when we commit with that "-a" , nothing will be commited if not staged
