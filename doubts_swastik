Problem 1: When created two branches branch1 and branch2 from master branch and changed file in branch1, the file in branch2 got automatically updated. After this, when I tried to edit that file with vi, the following error came.

E325: ATTENTION
Found a swap file by the name ".swastik.txt.swp"
          owned by: swastik   dated: Fri Sep  4 16:33:16 2015

      NEWER than swap file!

(1) Another program may be editing the same file.  If this is the case,
    be careful not to end up with two different instances of the same
    file when making changes.  Quit, or continue with caution.
(2) An edit session for this file crashed.
    If this is the case, use ":recover" or "vim -r swastik.txt"
    to recover the changes (see ":help recovery").
    If you did this already, delete the swap file ".swastik.txt.swp"
    to avoid this message.

Swap file ".swastik.txt.swp" already exists!
